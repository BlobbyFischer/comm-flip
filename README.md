# Exploring Commutative Matrix Multiplication Schemes via Flip Graphs

This repository contains the code and the data for the publication https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22113.

## Repository Overview

### C++ Core

- `Rank1Tensor.cpp`, `Rank1Tensor.h`  
  Define the `Rank1Tensor` class representing individual rank 1 tensors that sum to form a full tensor.

- `Scheme.cpp`, `Scheme.h`  
  Define the `Scheme` class representing a full decomposition into rank 1 tensors. Implements the flip graph exploration logic.

- `main.cpp`  
  Entry point for the program. Takes an input tensor decomposition and performs the flip graph search.

- `makefile`  
  Use `make` to compile the C++ code.

### Decompositions & Results

- `*.exp`  
  Files representing tensor decompositions. Each line is a rank 1 tensor. For example, `222.exp` is the standard `<2,2,2>` matrix multiplication tensor.

- `solutions/`  
  Contains output decompositions organized by tensor and rank.  
  Structure:
  ```
  solutions/
    tensor_name/
      x16/  # search results from method denoted by x of rank 16
      x15/  # search results from method denoted by x of rank 15
      y14/  # search results from method denoted by y of rank 14
  ```

### Python Scripts

- `down.py`  
  Automates large-scale flip graph searches. Given a starting directory and prefix, it performs multiple attempts to lower the decomposition rank by traversing the flip graph.

---

## Build Instructions

Compile the C++ code with:

```bash
make
```

This creates the executable `flip`.

---

## Basic Usage

To run a single flip graph search:

```bash
./flip 222.exp 100000
```

- `222.exp`: Input decomposition (e.g., rank 8 standard `<2,2,2>` tensor).
- `100000`: Number of steps to explore in the flip graph.

Output:

```
k250411112.exp,7
```

This means a new file `k250411112.exp` was generated â€” a **rank 7** commutative decomposition of the `<2,2,2>` tensor.

---

## Advanced Search with `down.py`

Use `down.py` for larger, automated searches.

### Expected Directory Structure

- A folder under `solutions/` representing the target tensor (e.g., `example1`).
- Subfolders for each known rank with decompositions:
  ```
  solutions/example1/x8/
  solutions/example1/y7/
  ```
  - `x`, `y` = prefixes representing different starting strategies (e.g., standard, Marakov-like).
  - Each subfolder contains one or more `.exp` files to search from.

### Example Command

```bash
python3 down.py example1 x 10000 100 25 8
```

#### Arguments:
1. `example1`: Target tensor folder under `solutions/`
2. `x`: Prefix used for search
3. `10000`: Number of steps per instance
4. `100`: Max failed attempts before stopping
5. `25`: Number of successful reductions to find
6. `8`: Number of parallel instances

If successful, it will create:

```
solutions/example1/x7/
```

containing 25 rank 7 commutative decompositions of `<2,2,2>`. If it found some decompositions of rank 6 it would also create:

```
solutions/example1/x6/
```

containing 25 rank 6 commutative decompositions of `<2,2,2>`, though it shouldn't and hence it will stop at rank 7.

### More Examples

```bash
python3 down.py example2 x 1000000 100 25 8
python3 down.py example2 y 1000000 100 25 8
```

- `example2`: Refers to the `<3,3,3>` matrix multiplication tensor.
- `x`: Search from the standard decomposition.
- `y`: Search from Marakov-like schemes found of rank 22
